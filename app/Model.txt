The files in this directory are simply
a formal way to declare table variables
to be able to access them within the controller
methods. Additionally, new models can be created
within controller methods and can be used to specify
where data goes when handling requests

To create models simply type

php artisan make:model ModelName

accompany this with a controller

php artisan make:controller ControllerName

these two files are used to query the database to get
and post information
